# Linear Regression
## Introduction
Linear regression models the relationship between a dependent variable (usually denoted as y) and one or more independent variables (usually denoted as x). It assumes a linear relationship between the input and output variables, and it is used to estimate the coefficients of the best-fitting line or hyperplane. The algorithm can be used for both simple linear regression (one input variable) and multiple linear regression (more than one input variable). A Linear Regression modelâ€™s main aim is to find the best fit linear line and the optimal values of intercept and coefficients such that the error is minimized. Error is the difference between the actual value and Predicted value and the goal is to reduce this difference.
## Algorithm Steps
* State the hypothesis.
* State the null hypothesis
* Gather the data.
* Compute the regression equation
* Examine tests of statistical significant and measures of association
* Relate statistical findings to the hypothesis. Accept or reject the null hypothesis.
* Reject, accept or revise the original hypothesis. Make suggestions for research design and management aspects of the problem
