# Logistic Regression
## Introduction
Logistic Regression is a type of statistical model used in machine learning for predicting the probability of a given outcome or class based on one or more input features. It is a popular method for binary classification problems and can be extended to multi-class classification using techniques like "one-vs-all" or "one-vs-one".
