A simple neural network, also known as a single-layer perceptron, is the most basic form of a neural network. It consists of a single layer of artificial neurons, or perceptrons, that are connected directly to the input features. Each perceptron computes a weighted sum of its input features and applies an activation function to generate an output. The single-layer perceptron can be used to solve linearly separable problems.

## Multiple Layer Neural Network:
A multi-layer neural network, also known as a deep neural network, consists of multiple layers of artificial neurons. These layers are organized in a hierarchical fashion, with the input layer connected to one or more hidden layers, which are in turn connected to the output layer. Each neuron in a hidden layer computes a weighted sum of the outputs from the previous layer and applies an activation function. The additional hidden layers enable the network to learn more complex, non-linear patterns in the data.
