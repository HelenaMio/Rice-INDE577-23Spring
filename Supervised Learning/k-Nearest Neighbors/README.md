# k-Nearest Neighbors
## Introduction
The K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) algorithm is a type of instance-based learning method used in machine learning. The K-NN algorithm is a type of lazy learning where the function is only approximated locally, and all computation is deferred until function evaluation. K-NN is often used for pattern recognition and, more specifically, for classification and regression.
## Algorithm
* Classification tasks: 
An unlabeled data point is assigned the label most prevalent among the 'k' nearest training samples to that query point.
The author applied K-NN to the fish dataset using Python and its libraries such as pandas, numpy, and sklearn.
* Regression tasks: 
The prediction for an unlabeled data point is computed by averaging the values of the 'k' nearest training samples to that query point.
The author applied K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) for regression on your house price dataset wusing libraries such as pandas, numpy, and sklearn.
## Datset
Fish.csv, house price.csv comes from Kaggle.
