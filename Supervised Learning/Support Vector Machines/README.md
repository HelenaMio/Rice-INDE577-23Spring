# Support Vector Machines
## Introduction
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a type of supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data and recognize patterns, used for classification and regression analysis.

## Steps

The general steps to perform SVM are:

1. **Collect and prepare the data:** This involves gathering the data and preparing it for use in the SVM model. This could include tasks like dealing with missing data and converting categorical data to numerical data.

2. **Choose a kernel:** The choice of kernel is somewhat dependent on the problem at hand. Some common choices include linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF).

3. **Split the data:** Split the data into a training set and a testing set.

4. **Train the model:** Use the training set to train the SVM model.

5. **Test the model:** This will give you an idea of how well your model will perform on unseen data.

6. **Tune the model:** This could involve things like choosing a different kernel or adjusting your parameters.
