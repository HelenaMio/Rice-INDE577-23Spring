# Rice-INDE577-23Spring
By Beixian Gu

## Course Description
This repository is created by Beixian Gu, a graduate student of industrial Engineering from Rice University. To display the algorithms of this course, this repository contains the introductions and applications covering supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforment learning.
The insturctor of this course is Dr. Davila. We use Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition, by Aurélien Géron as text book. The goal of this course is provide students with algorithms and implementations of datasets and machine learnings.
