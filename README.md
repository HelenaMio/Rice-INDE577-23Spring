# Course Description
This data science course covers algorithms from supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and if time permits, reinforcement learning. We will implement many of the machine learning algorithms from scratch, but will also make use of the Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow libraries. Topics include, but are not limited to:

* Supervised Learning:
  *  Model Building and Error Analysis
  * Linear Regression
  * Gradient Descent
  * Logistic Regression
  * Neural Nets
* Support Vector Machines
  * k-Nearest Neighbors
  * Decision/ Regression Trees
  * Ensemble Learning

* Unsupervised Learning:
  * k-Means Clustering
  * Principal Component Analysis

* Reinforcement Learning:
  * Tabular versus Deep Learning Methods
